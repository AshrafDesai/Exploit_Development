# Exploit_Development

## Overview

This folder contains a collection of vulnerability scanners and their corresponding exploit codes. These tools are designed for security professionals, researchers, and developers to analyze and exploit vulnerabilities in various software and systems.

## Contents

- **Vulnerability Scanners:**
  - **1. Eternal_Blue_vulnerability_checker:** The EternalBlue Scanner is a Python script designed to detect if a target system is vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit (MS17-010). EternalBlue is a vulnerability in Microsoft's implementation of the   Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. 

- **Exploit Codes:**
  - Each scanner folder contains exploit codes for vulnerabilities identified by the respective scanner.
  - Exploit codes are organized by vulnerability type or target software.

## Usage

1. **Download and Installation:**
   - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Vulnerability Scanning:**
   - Navigate to the folder of the desired vulnerability scanner.
   - Follow the instructions provided in the scanner's README file for installation and usage.

3. **Exploit Development:**
   - Explore the exploit codes available in the corresponding scanner folders.
   - Choose the exploit code based on the target vulnerability or software.
   - Follow the instructions provided in the exploit's README file for usage and execution.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have discovered new vulnerabilities or developed exploit codes for existing vulnerabilities, feel free to submit pull requests.

Please ensure the following guidelines are met when contributing:

- Provide clear documentation for new vulnerability scanners and exploit codes.
- Ensure the code is well-commented and follows best practices.
- Test the code thoroughly before submission to avoid any unintended consequences.

## Disclaimer

The exploit codes provided in this repository are for educational and research purposes only. Misuse of these tools to exploit systems without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. The developers and maintainers of this repository are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by the use of these tools.
